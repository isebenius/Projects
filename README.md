# Projects

This repository contains a selection of my projects in bioinformatics and data analysis.

In the following lines, I describe the goals of each project:

  RNA-seq classification.ipynb:
      Uses second-order markov model to determine whether RNA seq reads came from one of two populations.

  Clustering.ipynb:
      Implements hard k-means and mixture model algorithms to cluster RNA-seq data according to cell identity.
